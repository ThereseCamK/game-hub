Process🔗
Images and Icons
Decide which images should be added as an <img> element in the HTML and which should be added with CSS. A useful question to ask is ‘would a visually impaired user like to know about this image?‘.
Add the images.
Apply the appropriate styling.
Forms
Look at your prototype and consider what different elements you’ll need. For example, text inputs, number inputs, select elements etc.
Open the Contact page in VS Code and add the elements.
Navigation
Style the navigation to look like your prototype. This might include adding the checkbox hack for showing a hamburger menu on mobile and having the navigation displaying on desktop. NOTE: Please don’t add two navigations, one for mobile and one for desktop. Have one navigation you style differently for different screen sizes.
Style your links, this could include updating your call-to-action links.
CSS Box Model
Find elements that need padding, margin or border applied to them and style them appropriately.
Questions to ask yourself about the CA so far
Are my images loading correctly and look like they should?
Is my form using the correct inputs and is it bug free?
Does my navigation look good and is it correctly laid out?
Have I used padding, margin, and border to add space to elements?
