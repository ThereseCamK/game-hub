Process🔗
Bug Fixing
Open up your developer tools in your browser.
Use the responsive design mode and make sure that there are no horizontal scrollbars at any width, as well as that the site looks good across screen sizes.
If you do encounter bugs and issues, use the developer tools to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.
Use the Wave tools to test the site’s accessibility.
Use the W3C Markup Validation Service to test the HTML of your site.
Animations and Transitions
Consider if there are any places you can add animations or transitions to your website to smooth out the interactions. If there are, add them to the website.
CSS Variables
Identify values that get used often, fonts and colors are usually good examples.
Create your CSS Variables and update the values to use your newly created variables.
Questions to ask yourself about the CA so far
Is my code bug-free?
Can I use CSS Variables to avoid repeated values?
Can I use animations and transitions to smooth interactions on the site?
To help answer these questions, you can use:

W3C Validator
Test on different devices
Outcomes for this module🔗
You should now be able to say:

“I write bug-free HTML”
“I am confident with using CSS Variables”
“I understand how animations and transitions are added, and can add them to a website”
